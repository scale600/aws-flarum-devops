# üóëÔ∏è DELETE ALL AWS RESOURCES - Complete List

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPREHENSIVE DELETION - Every Single Resource

This guide covers **EVERY** AWS resource that might exist for this project:
- ‚úÖ EC2 Instances
- ‚úÖ RDS Databases
- ‚úÖ ALB (Application Load Balancers)
- ‚úÖ ELB (Classic Load Balancers)
- ‚úÖ Amplify Applications
- ‚úÖ S3 Buckets
- ‚úÖ And everything else

## üéØ METHOD 1: Terraform Destroy (RECOMMENDED - Deletes Everything)

This is the **FASTEST and MOST COMPLETE** method:

```bash
# 1. Configure AWS CLI (one-time setup)
aws configure
# Enter:
# - AWS Access Key ID: (from your GitHub secrets)
# - AWS Secret Access Key: (from your GitHub secrets)
# - Region: us-east-1
# - Output: json

# 2. Go to terraform directory
cd /Users/richardlee/Dev/project/aws-flarum-devops/terraform

# 3. Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# 4. Destroy EVERYTHING
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

This will delete:
- ‚úÖ All EC2 instances
- ‚úÖ All RDS databases
- ‚úÖ All load balancers (ALB/ELB)
- ‚úÖ All S3 buckets
- ‚úÖ All VPC resources
- ‚úÖ All security groups
