## Option 2: Terraform Destroy (Recommended)

If you have AWS CLI configured:

```bash
cd /Users/richardlee/Dev/project/aws-flarum-devops/terraform

# Configure AWS credentials first (if not already done)
aws configure

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Preview what will be destroyed
terraform plan -destroy

terraform destroy

# Type 'yes' when prompted
```

**This will automatically delete:**

- ‚úÖ Security Groups
- ‚úÖ Key Pairs
- ‚úÖ IAM Roles and Instance Profiles
- ‚úÖ Any RDS, S3, or ALB resources (if they exist)

---

## Option 3: Automated Script

If you have AWS CLI configured:

```bash
cd /Users/richardlee/Dev/project/aws-flarum-devops

# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/cleanup-all-resources.sh

# Run cleanup
./scripts/cleanup-all-resources.sh

# Type 'DELETE' when prompted to confirm
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

After cleanup, verify all resources are gone:

### Check EC2:
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:
```
Should show: No instances (or only terminated ones)

### Check RDS:
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#databases:
```
Should show: No databases

### Check S3:
```
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets?region=us-east-1
```
Should show: No riderhub/flarum buckets

### Check Billing:
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bills
```
Should show: $0.00 for current month (after cleanup)

---

## üí∞ Cost Verification

After cleanup, your AWS bill should be:
- **Current month:** Small charges for time resources were running
- **Next month:** $0.00 ‚úÖ

---

## üìù Optional: Delete GitHub Repository

If you also want to remove the code:

```bash
# Locally
cd /Users/richardlee/Dev/project
rm -rf aws-flarum-devops

# On GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/scale600/aws-flarum-devops/settings
# Scroll to bottom ‚Üí Delete this repository
# Type repository name to confirm
```

---

## üîÑ Reactivating Later

If you want to redeploy later:

1. The GitHub repository will still have all the code
2. Just run the GitHub Actions workflow again
3. Or run `terraform apply` locally
4. All resources will be recreated fresh

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Termination Protection:** None of your resources have termination protection, so they can be deleted immediately

2. **Snapshots:** We skip final snapshots to avoid costs

3. **Billing:** It takes 24-48 hours for AWS billing to reflect the deletions

4. **Free Tier:** Even after cleanup, your Free Tier remains active for 12 months

5. **Data Loss:** All data will be permanently lost (database, uploaded files, etc.)

---

## üéØ Recommended Order

**Easiest and Fastest:**
1. Use AWS Console (Option 1) - 10 minutes
2. Follow steps 1-9 in order
3. Verify everything is deleted

**Most Reliable:**
1. Configure AWS CLI: `aws configure`
2. Run `terraform destroy` - 5 minutes
3. Automatically cleans everything

---

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter errors during cleanup:
- Security Group "in use" ‚Üí Wait 5 more minutes, EC2 still terminating
- VPC "has dependencies" ‚Üí Delete EC2, ALB, RDS first, then try again
- IAM Role "in use" ‚Üí Remove from instance profile first
